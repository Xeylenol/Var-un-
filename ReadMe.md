## Getting Started

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

If Python is not installed on your machine, you can install it from the official website - [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/).

# Usage

To install the Python libraries, you can use pip, which is a package manager for Python. You can install these libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install matplotlib
```
If you do not have pip installed, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
python get-pip.py
```
If you are using a Mac, you can use the following command to install pip:

```bash
sudo easy_install pip
```
Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
gh repo clone Xeylenol/Var-un-
```

Once you have Python and the necessary libraries installed, you can run the Python scripts in this repository.

To run a script, navigate to the directory containing the script using the command line. Then, use the following command:

```bash
python script_name.py
```
